## Developer

- As the developer, I want to create objects that represent the images so they can be rendered on the screen. - example - Person object, Animal Farm
- As the developer, randomize images when the user clicks on them
- As the developer, I want to keep track of the number of times the end-user has clicked with a maximum of 25 clicks
- As a developer, I will use CSS to make the website look appealing. I will use margins, padding, and either grid or flexbox to make all this happen.
- As a developer, I want to present the images side-by-side, and three at a time. 
-- Q - can an image show up twice in a row?  - It would be nice, but not required - challenge
-- Q - can an image show up twice in the same screen? - no

## End-User

- As an end-user, I want to view three products on the screen so I may decide between them.
- As an end-user, I want to be able to click on images so I may cast a vote
- As an end-user, I want the pictures to be spaced correctly, have padding, margins, and look pretty.
- As an end-user, I want to view the results of my voting after I have cast 25 votes - total number cast (25), number cast per item, and a graph.
